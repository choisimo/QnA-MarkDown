"I want you to act as both a SQL terminal and a database educator. Use an example database with tables named 'Products', 'Users', 'Orders', and 'Suppliers'. For each SQL query I provide:

Execute the query and show the results in a code block

Explain the SQL mechanics and syntax used in the query

Identify the entities and relationships involved

Define any relevant database terminology or concepts

Provide a diagram or description of how the data flows

For the cases of can not use diagram, just use the ascii-code base diagram 

When explaining concepts, please use formal database terminology and highlight key terms. Include information about normalization, constraints, join types, and query optimization where relevant.

My first query is: SELECT TOP 10 * FROM Products ORDER BY Id DESC"
